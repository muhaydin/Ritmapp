RITM project aims to estimate the electrical power to be produced in electricity generation facilities operated by wind energy, which is an intermittent energy source. 
The code I wrote gets the background version of the data graphed on the relevant RITM website and transfrom into tables based on date and time. The packages used are 
shiny, shinythemes, shinyalert, shinyWidgets, readr and DT.
